      %h2 ARMap eBook
      %p A book with plain pages stands on a pedestal. When a person approaches it, the text slowly appears on its pages. When a page is turned, the book reacts by showing different page contents respecting the direction of a page flip.

          %img.thumb(src="images/ebook#{i}.png")
      %p The work being a collaboration with Richard Janecek was featured in the National Technical Library (NTK) Gallery in Prague. It uses Kinect and a digital projector to achieve the mentioned effect, so similarly to ARMap Sandbox the technology stays well hidden from casual passers-by.

      %h2 ARMap Sandbox
      %p Interactive Augmented Reality Mapping Sandbox. Kinect reads the height map of the world created by people from sand. This height information is then translated by a computer into the corresponding color, which is then projected on the sand surface via a digital projector.

      %p Originally a collaboration with Tomas Mudrunka, based on the work by Oliver Kreylos. Now powered by a custom lightweight open-source software capable of running on embedded devices like Raspberry Pi or Beagleboard.

      %h2 Mirrsaic - NOW
      %p A collaboration with Prokop Bartonicek. My responsibility was to create a software capable of visualizing the scene including sun rays and mirror reflections. Custom-cut mirror shapes and a calibration pattern were also produced by the very same software.

      %p.desc In an urban scene we can see solar reflections of geometric forms. Abstract composition described by the sun is approaching from above towards the ground. After several hours, the shapes overlap, thus creating a powerful light cluster, which is changing very fast in an interlocking inscription. Individual light fragments at the moment of encounter rendering the word "NOW" which accurately captures the transience of the moment.
      %p.desc Today, the availability of efficient design and lighting technologies, mapping and generative art is often oblivious to the basic rules of light, time and space. I decided to create a impressive public space light installation that would work within the elementary principles. Mirrsaic, as a process and a tool was programmed, generated and manufactured using the most modern techniques and technologies, which are not directly seen by the viewer. The most complicated project tool is hidden; it remains just a wall, a daylight system and several mirrors in the exact shape, the exact place at the exact time.

      %h2 Potbox
      %p Interactive video-feedback VJing software. A camera is pointed to the computer screen, its picture is modified by a chain of custom made visual filters, which is then shown again on the very same screen. This feedback creates a complex chaotic system of colorful visuals.

          %img.thumb(src="images/potbox#{i}.png")
      %p The project uses OpenCV for retrieving the camera stream, which is later rendered using OpenGL and an advanced pixel-shader. The behavior of this shader is controlled by an attached MIDI controller, which in combination with a movable camera provides an easy and intuitive way how to interact with the process that generates the images. Audio can also be used to change the filter parameters resulting in visuals that react to volume and/or frequency of the recorded sound.
